P4 – Madlibs

My P4 application is an update of my P3 that utilizes the P2 PHP framework to store user input into a database and display it in a blog format. The user is prompted to fill out a form requesting a series of words identified by their parts of speech (e.g. nouns, verb, adjective, proper name, etc.). Once the form is submitted the form inputs are inserted into text, substituting various word in the original text, often resulting in a comical or absurd version of (in this case) well-known texts. My P4 app offers two Madlib options. One is a passage from William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet and the other is a part of the Beatles song Eleanor Rigby.

Users are required to sign in/log in with an email and password. All of the Madlibs that each user creates are associated with that user in the database. Users can follow or unfollow other users, whose Madlibs will appear in the blog feed.
